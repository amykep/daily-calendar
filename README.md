# Daily Calendar
This application provides the user with a work day calendar to manage their events.  User can add, edit, and delete events. The calendar retains events for the duration of the day, and resets at midnight.

### Key Elements
In this app I deployed the following:
1. Bootstrap
2. JavaScript Get Date Methods
3. jQuery
4. LocalStorage
5. Fontawesome

### Development Outline
1. Worked on getting the current date to display in the header.
2. Worked on building the structure for displaying the calendar by using bootstrap to layout the cols.
3. Used the time block as an id to easily store and pull data from localStorage.
4. Created a function to check the current date with the date of the saved data in locaStorage and only display the saved calendarInpus for today.
5. Enabled users to input, edit or delete calendar events
